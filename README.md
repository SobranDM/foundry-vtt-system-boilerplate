# Boilerplate System

![Foundry v13](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v13-green)

## Unofficial!

Please note that this is an unofficial fork of the Foundry boilerplate system found [here](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate). I am not affiliated with Foundry in any way. This was created for my own use and is only provided as a convenience in case it might be of use to anyone. Use at your own risk.

Refer to official boilerplate for usage instructions. Python build may not work.

See Changelog for important changes.

# Boilerplate System

![Foundry v13](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v13-green)

## Unofficial!

Please note that this is an unofficial fork of the Foundry boilerplate found [here](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate). I am not affiliated with Foundry in any way. This fork makes some minor changes for v13 and will attempt to add Typescript support by default going forward. This was created for my own use and is only provided as a convenience in case it might be of use to anyone. Use at your own risk. Refer to official boilerplate for usage instructions.
